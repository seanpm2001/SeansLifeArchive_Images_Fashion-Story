# Fashion Story session August 12th 2021

<!-- I had a short session today, as I didn't feel like playing. There wasn't a malicious amount of popups today. I ordered 1 batch of stock (Bow heels) 1 minute per batch, then I quit. !-->

I had a much shorter session today, ordering 2 batches of stock (bow heels, 15 minutes each) and quit early (I was going to play longer, but I accidentally clicked on the billboard 3 times, crashing the game each time)

<!-- I had a very short session today, as I was wanting to brush past this game. There weren't a malicious amount of popups again today, I just wanted to quit early, so I ordered 1 batch of stock, restocked, and quit. !-->

## Overview

See above.
