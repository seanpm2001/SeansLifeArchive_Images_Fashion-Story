# Fashion Story session April 29th 2021

I had a very short session today, as I was not having a very good time. The game has a ridiculous amount of popups, and due to playing without a case, and being a little careless, I accidentally clicked the ad billboard 4 times, each time softlocking the game, so I had to reopen the app each time. It was extremely annoying. I only ordered 1 batch of 1 minute stock today.

## Overview
