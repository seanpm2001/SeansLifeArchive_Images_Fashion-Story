# Fashion Story session April 1st 2021

I had a normal session today that lasted over 4 minutes (but less than 10 minutes) I played longer than normal today to make more stock.

## Remodeling

No remodeling was done today.

## Clothing and fashion items

I made nearly 1000 luxe bags today. I was going to just make 1 batch, but I decided to play a little longer today.

## Revenue

No revenue was made today. I have had my fashion stands closed off, as I am stocking up. I have not reopened the displays yet.
